## Intro

### What's the point in this backend?

The whole purpose of this is for me to learn rust and how to integrate actix, sqlx, and tokio to create a backend with API endpoints for a PostgreSQL database.

Working with ORMs with NodeJS is quick and easy. It may be overkill for most projects but as an up front investment, I think rust will be worth it in the end.
